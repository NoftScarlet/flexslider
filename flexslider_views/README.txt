About
=====

This adds a new display mode to views called "Flex Slider". Similar to how you select "Page" or "Block" as display modes, Flex Slider Views allows you to build a view and display fields using Flex Slider.

This module doesn't require Views UI to be enabled but it is required if you want to configure your Views display using Flex Slider through the web interface. This ensures you can leave Views UI off once everything is setup.

Usage
=====

Go to Views andUse the display mode "FlexSlider"
